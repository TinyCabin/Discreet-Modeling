# üåê Discrete Modeling Simulations

This project demonstrates various discrete modeling techniques in computational simulations. It includes classic models like **Game of Life**, **LBM Flow Simulation**, **Diffusion**, **Lattice Gas Automata (LGA)**, and simple **Image Transformations**.

## üõ† Features
- **Game of Life**: A cellular automaton simulation where cells evolve based on simple rules.
- **LBM  Simulation**: A simulation of fluid dynamics using the **Lattice Boltzmann Method** (LBM) with visualizations for density and velocity.
- **Diffusion Simulation**: A model to simulate diffusion processes in discrete space.
- **Lattice Gas Automata (LGA)**: A technique for simulating particle dynamics using a grid-based approach.
- **Image Transformation**: Simple algorithms to apply transformations to images using discrete methods.
